# New Horizonz

A blog about Offensive Security Adventures

The theme I am using for my blog is PaperMod, but with a lot of customizations.

I am not a maintainer, I just keep modifying the theme for my own blog.
If you want to use the theme, just delete the posts (& google analytics tag) and feel free to use mine :)

## What's Changed

- Floating TOCs + Responsive, static on mobile
- Medium-like Zoom for Images
- Dracula theme (in highlight.js) for code syntax highlighting
- Terminal box around code
- Added a glamorous About Me page ;)
- A Projects page with custom layout and UI + External Links support
- Enhanced:
    - copy button
    - <code\> bg
    - <abbr\> and <a\> tags
- Glitch animation for site title and some other elements
- Glow animation on:
    - site title on home page
    - posts in listing view
    - buttons in header
    - TOCs
    - copy button
    - move-to-top button in footer
- Color change animation on links in posts
- Box animation on post names on Archive page
- Count of posts removed on Archive page (I don't like it)
- Author name removed (no need for a single writer when there is an about page)
- Images (and many other elements) with more rounded corners
- Better sharing button social icons
