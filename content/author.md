AoA!

You're probably here wanting to know a little about who I am and what I do.

Since November 2021, I am doing my BS degree in Computer Science.

I am a Computers Security enthusiast, driven by Curiosity, love linux, enjoy scripting & have fun playing CTFs. I like Threat Intelligence but love Offensive Security and, currently, am into Exploit Development.

This blog serves the purpose of a medium for me to document my journey into the field of Cyber Security and to share CTF write-ups as well as anything interesting I come across in my study/research. I hope you find my posts informative :slightly_smiling_face:
