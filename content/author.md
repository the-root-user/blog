AoA!

You're probably here wanting to know a little about who I am and what I do.

Since November 2021, I have been working on my BS degree in Computer Science.

I have a passion for Computer Security and am a hacker driven by curiosity. I love Linux, like scripting, and have fun playing CTFs. I like Threat Intelligence but adore Offensive Security and, currently, am into Exploit Development.

This blog serves the purpose of a medium for me to chronicle my journey into the world of Cyber Security and to share CTF write-ups as well as anything interesting I come across in my studies or research. I hope you find my posts informative :slightly_smiling_face:

[Here](../projects) are some projects of mine, if you wanna check out.
